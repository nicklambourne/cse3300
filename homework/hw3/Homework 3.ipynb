I cannot identify where the slow start ends and begins definitively (even in the zoomed second image), but it appears to conclude before 0.15 seconds (and, I assume, begins at t=0), after which congestion avoidance likely takes over. This data differs significantly from the model as described in class due to the face that the data appears to be transferring at a fixed rate for most of the transfer, rather than increasing (this is likely due to it hitting the receiver window (RWND) limit). What I mean by that is the congestion window (cwnd) appears to reach a fixed maximum and never increases again.
