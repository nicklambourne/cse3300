    "\n",
    "### Network Edge\n",
    "Hosts: clients and servers.\n",
    "Access Networks, physical nodes, wired/wireless communication links (can be shared or dedicated).\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### Hosts\n",
    "-  Send and recieve data (bits).\n",
    "-  Data is taken and broken into packets of length L (bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Packet Transfer Delay = Transmission Rate = \n",
    "\n",
    "Time to Transmit L-bit packet = $\\frac{L (bits)}{R (bits/second)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Core\n",
    "-  Packet Switching: hosts break application layer information into packets and forward from one router to the next (Each packet is transmitted at full speed capacity).\n",
    "-  Store-and-forward: Each packet much arrive in full before retransmission. It takes L/R seconds to transmit L-bit packets at R bps (end-to-end delay is 2L/R).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queuing and Loss\n",
    "-  If arrival and rate to link is greater than the transmission rate of link, packets will queue, waiting for transmission.\n",
    "-  Packets are stored in memory (buffer).\n",
    "-  Packets will be lost if the number of queued packets starts to exceed the storage capacity of the router doing the forwarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Routing: determines source-destination route taken by packets (using forwarding tables and routing algorithms).\n",
    "-  Forwarding: move packets from source's input to the appropriate output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit Switching: Alternative to Packet-Switching\n",
    "-  End-to-end resources allocated to/reserved for \"call\" between source and destination.\n",
    "-  No sharing (guaranteed performance, but lots of idle time/waste).\n",
    "-  Used by traditional telephone networks.\n",
    "-  ![FDM vs TDM](img/fdm.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Delay, Loss & Throughput\n",
    "-  Loss occurs if packets are being received at a rate higher than the processing speed of the receiving node.\n",
    "    -  Packets \"fall off\" queue (memory) when queue is full and new packets are still arriving.\n",
